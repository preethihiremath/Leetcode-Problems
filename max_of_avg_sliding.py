# You are given an integer array nums consisting of n elements, and an integer k.

# Find a contiguous subarray whose length is equal to k that has the maximum average value and return this value. Any answer with a calculation error less than 10-5 will be accepted.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [1,12,-5,-6,50,3], k = 4
# Output: 12.75000
# Explanation: Maximum average is (12 - 5 - 6 + 50) / 4 = 51 / 4 = 12.75


class Solution:
    def findMaxAverage(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> float:
        
        sum_of_k= sum(nums[0:k])
        max_sum=sum_of_k

        for i in range(k,len(nums)):

            sum_of_k= sum_of_k + nums[i] - nums[i-k]
            if sum_of_k > max_sum:
                max_sum= sum_of_k
        return max_sum/k
