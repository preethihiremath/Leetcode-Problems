# Hint
# You are given a string s, which contains stars *.

# In one operation, you can:

# Choose a star in s.
# Remove the closest non-star character to its left, as well as remove the star itself.
# Return the string after all stars have been removed.

# Note:

# The input will be generated such that the operation is always possible.
# It can be shown that the resulting string will always be unique.

    def removeStars(self, s: str) -> str:
        stack= list(s)

        res= []

        for i in range(len(stack)):
            if(s[i] == "*"):
                val= res.pop()
            else:
                res.append(s[i])

        return "".join(res)
